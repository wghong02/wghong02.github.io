Analyzed theimpact of gene's aging on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through the mouse model using R.

Performed RNA sequencing and single cell RNA sequencing with existing lab pipelines and R packages including scRNAseq, seurat, and deseq2.

Identified key gene markers via gene enrichment analysis, such as GSEA and PEA.
Developed a visualization pipeline that uses heatmaps, bar graphs, and upset graphs.
