**TCW Lab, Bioinformatics Research**						      	          Jan 2022- Mar 2023
Analyzed theimpact of gene's aging on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through the mouse model using R.
Performed RNA sequencing and single cell RNA sequencing with existing lab pipelines and R packages including scRNAseq, seurat, and deseq2.
Identified key gene markers via gene enrichment analysis, such as GSEA and PEA.
Developed a visualization pipeline that uses heatmaps, bar graphs, and upset graphs.
